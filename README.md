### 1. Background
In this KE5006 class, I'd like to develop my research skills as well as machine learning coding skills by attending this real-world challenge MoNuSAC 2020. My initial plan is to get familiar with this challenge and learn how to find related existing research paper and code, then, understand the existing work. After all, come out novel idea and implement it to make better result out of it.

### 2. MoNuSAC Introduction
Different types of cells play a vital role in the initiation, development, invasion, metastasis and therapeutic response of tumors of various organs. So, accurate identification and segmentation of nuclei of multiple cell-types is important for AI enabled characterization of tumor and its microenvironment.

### 3. Data Description & Exploration
H&E staining of human tissue sections is a routine and most common protocol used by pathologists to enhance the contrast of tissue sections for tumor assessment (grading, staging, etc.) at multiple microscopic resolutions.

### 4. Hypothese and Goal
#### 1. Normalize images
